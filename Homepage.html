            <h3>East Blue Saga</h3>
            <p>
            The series begins with the execution of Gol D Roger, a man known as The Pirate King (海賊王 Kaizoku-Ō?). Just before his death, Gol D Roger makes mention of his great legendary treasure, the One Piece (ワンピース『ひとつなぎの大秘宝』 Wan Pīsu?) and that it can be taken by whoever finds it. This marks the beginning of an era known as the Great Pirate Age (大海賊時代 Daikaizokujidai?). As a result, countless pirates set sail for the Grand Line, the sea where the treasure is located, to find it.

            More than twenty years after Roger's death, the One Piece has still not been found. A young man named Monkey D. Luffy, who ate the Gum Gum Fruit, which gave him elasticity, inspired by his childhood admiration for the mighty pirate Shanks the Redhead, begins his adventure from his home in the East Blue Sea to find the One Piece and proclaim himself the new King of Pirates. In order to create and become the captain of a crew of his own by recruiting several comrades, the boy founds the Straw Hat Pirates (麦わら海賊団篇 Mugiwara Kaizoku-dan?), with swordsman Roronoa Zoro being the first one Luffy enlists after rescuing him from the Marines, allowing the two to continue to embark on their journey to the treasure. Soon after, Nami, a thieving sailor, Usopp, a lying sniper, and Sanji, a cook with a crush on women join them on their voyages, as well as getting a ship called the Going Merry. On their voyages, the crew faces several powerful enemies such as Buggy the Clown, Captain Kuro, Don Krieg, and the fish-man Arlong.  The group arrives in Loguetown, a port town, and Luffy meets a naval officer named Smoker, who has the ability to transform into smoke and intends to capture him but is stopped by a man named Dragon.

            <p>
            After finally arriving at the Grand Line, the group meets Crocus, the lighthouse keeper and keeper of Laboon, a giant whale, at the entrance. He gives them information about navigating the sea and about Laugh Tale, the island where Roger left the One Piece. They also meet Nefertari Vivi, a princess who wishes to save her country, the Kingdom of Arabasta, from a dangerous criminal organisation called Baroque Works, and she and her pet duck Karoo travel with the crew for a time.  During their journey to Arabasta, the pirates arrive in Little Garden, where they befriend two local giants, and encounter several members of Baroque Works. After Nami falls ill from their passage there, they arrive on Drum Island in search of medical help, where the Straw Hat crew invite an anthropomorphic reindeer and doctor named Tony Tony Chopper to join them, and he accepts.  Once the crew reaches Arabasta, they begin a series of battles against the Baroque Works and their leader, the Sea Warrior Sir Crocodile.  Luffy finally defeats Crocodile and frees the kingdom, after which the crew has to say goodbye to Vivi.  Immediately afterwards, Nico Robin, an archaeologist formerly of Baroque Works, joins the crew.

Teach, who also aspires to become the King of Pirates.  The crew travels to an island in the sky called Skypiea, where they inadvertently join an insipient war between two local tribes, which leads them to confront the island s leader, Enel, who possesses the power to create lightning and electricity.  Luffy manages to defeat him, thus ending the war.

            <p>
            After an encounter with the Foxy Pirates, who challenge them to a series of pirate games, a Navy admiral named Aokiji appears to them and tells them that Robin has been involved in a search for archaic stones called poneglyphs, which were created by an ancient civilisation and contain the encrypted history that the World Government erased from the world eight hundred years ago.  After this encounter, the Straw Hat crew arrive at Water 7, where the local carpenters inform them that the Going Merry is too badly damaged to be repaired, causing Usopp to resign from the crew.  They then have an encounter with a cyborg named Franky, the leader of the Franky Family, as well as the ward of Tom, who built the Pirate King s ship. CP9, an intelligence agency of the World Government, captures Robin and Franky, in order to get them to reveal information regarding the use of the poneglyphs and the ancestral weapons they may contain, so their friends go to their rescue at Enies Lobby, where the Straw Hat people declare war on the Government itself, resulting in a series of fights between the pirates and CP9.  At the end of the final battle against the agents, the crew manages to rescue Robin. Franky also builds a new ship, the Thousand Sunny, to replace the lost Going Merry, and joins the crew as their carpenter.  Afterwards, Usopp apologises to his shipmates for leaving, returning to join them again.

            <p>
            Sailing on their new ship, the pirates encounter a ghost ship, where they meet Brook, a skeletal musician who was revived with a devil fruit, and furthermore, whose shadow was stolen by Gecko Moria, another member of the Seven Sea Warriors and captain of the giant pirate ship Thriller Bark.  Once the pirates defeat Moria, Brook joins them.  After reaching the Sabaody Archipelago, the crew prepares to enter the New World, the second half of the Grand Line. While there, they befriend Silvers Rayleigh, the former first mate of the crew of Roger s Pirates, and ask him to coat their ship so that they can cross the Red Line through the ocean floor.  There, the Straw Hat crew become involved in a revolt caused by a World Noble; to end the turmoil, one of the Seven Sea Warriors, Bartholomew Kuma, separates them by sending them to different locations using his powers.  Luffy arrives on an aphrodisiac island called Amazon Lily, inhabited only by women, and ruled by Boa Hancock, one of the Seven Sea Warriors.  Once the boy learns that Portgas D. Ace, his adopted brother, is imprisoned on Impel Down, Luffy sets out on a journey to free him, and in the process manages to free other prisoners, such as the fish-man and Sea Warrior Jinbe, who was imprisoned after refusing to cooperate with the government, and old enemies.  However, the protagonist realises that his brother is now in Marineford to be executed by Navy soldiers. As soon as he arrives, war breaks out between the Navy forces, and the crew of the renowned Edward Newgate, known worldwide as Barbablanca. Amidst the chaos and climax of the battle, Ace and Whitebeard are killed.  Luffy mourns the loss of Ace, much like the loss he experienced as a child with his other adopted brother, Sabo. With Jinbe s help and at Rayleigh s request, Luffy decides to send his friends a message to wait two years until they meet again, all of them going through an intense training regimen, some of them under the supervision of important figures.

After being defeated, the alliance moves to Dressrosa, a kingdom dominated by the Sea Warrior Donquixote Doflamingo, who secretly controls a black market for artificial devil fruit, known as SMILE.  Once there, Luffy enters a competition whose prize for coming in first place is the Mera Mera fruit, which previously belonged to his deceased brother Ace; however, his other adopted brother, Sabo, makes himself known to Luffy, who initially distrusts him as he believed him to be dead as well, but then gives him his place in the tournament so that he can win the prize while he dedicates himself to saving his nakama from the attack of the Donquixote Pirates.  After the Sea Warrior is defeated by the crew, the Navy agrees to hush up the incidents, and they decide to call a meeting with all the kingdoms affiliated with the World Government.  Soon after, the Straw Hats split up, being separated within two days, as the new companion named Kin emon, who joins them from Punk Hazard, tells them that they must find their friend Raizo to accomplish a special mission who is on a ghost island.

While the others escape on the Sunny, sacrificing Pedro to give them a head start, Luffy fights Katakuri, one of Big Mom s sons, and Sanji tries to bake a cake to distract Big Mom. Reaching the borders of Totto Land, Luffy and the others flee while Sanji s family and the Sun Pirates fight Big Mom s fleet, with Jinbe separating from them and promising to meet again in Wano.
