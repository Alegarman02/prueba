        <h2>Here we have some frequently asked questions: </h2>

        <h3><img src="images/one_piece__icon26.png" title="One Piece Icon" alt="One Piece Icon Image">   What is the currency in the One Piece world?</h3>
        <p>The money used in all 5 major oceans are called Berries. According to one fan Q&A the author said one cabbage is worth 250 Berries (orig. Beli).</p>
    
        <h3><img src="images/one_piece__icon26.png" title="One Piece Icon" alt="One Piece Icon Image">   What are the five major oceans in the One Piece world?</h3>
        <p>East Blue, West Blue, South Blue, North Blue, and the Grand Line.</p>

        <h3><img src="images/one_piece__icon26.png" title="One Piece Icon" alt="One Piece Icon Image">   What's up with the guy who looks like a panda who appears in the background in most of the episodes?</h3>
        <p>That's Pandaman, a character who was created by Oda-san himself who was originally created as a new idea character for the Muscle Man series. Pandaman portrays as a "Where's Waldo?" type of character in this anime</p>

        <h3><img src="images/one_piece__icon26.png" title="One Piece Icon" alt="One Piece Icon Image">   What are the name of the three types of Devil Fruits?</h3>
        <p>Paramecia Type - The user's body gains inhuman abilities that can either alter the body's appearance entirely or partly.
            
            Logia Type - The user is able to tranform into a natural element.
            
            Zoan Type - The user is able to transform into a hybrid or physical looking animal.</p>

        <h3><img src="images/one_piece__icon26.png" title="One Piece Icon" alt="One Piece Icon Image">   Can Zoan Type Users talk to other animals?</h3>
        <p>No, they are only able to transform into a single type of animal, but they don't gain the ability to speak to animals. The only reason why Chopper is able to understand other animals is because he was one to begin with.</p>

        <h3><img src="images/one_piece__icon26.png" title="One Piece Icon" alt="One Piece Icon Image">   Does Usopp's nose serve as a sniping point to help his aim better?</h3>
        <p>There were times when he made a perfect shot with his head turned away from the slingshot. So no, his nose doesn't serve any purpose for his marksmanship.</p>

        <h3><img src="images/one_piece__icon26.png" title="One Piece Icon" alt="One Piece Icon Image">   Is there really a Pirate Summit?</h3>
        <p>No, that was a mis-translation in an earlier subtitle version of one episode. It was actually a figure of speech that goes "See you at the top" where "top" can easily be mistaken for "summit" in Japanese.</p>

        <h3><img src="images/one_piece__icon26.png" title="One Piece Icon" alt="One Piece Icon Image">   Are Mer-people different from Fishmen in this anime?</h3>
        <p>Mer-people are recognized as humans with fish fins for a lower body part.
            
            While Fishmen are aquatic humanoids that resemble any kind of fish with gills, and web feet/hands.
            
            Eichiro Oda had explained that these two groups of species are different from one another.</p>

        <h3><img src="images/one_piece__icon26.png" title="One Piece Icon" alt="One Piece Icon Image">   Do the Shichibuchai have to leave their own crew?</h3>
        <p>No, there's no such rule that they have to leave their own crew.</p>

        <h3><img src="images/one_piece__icon26.png" title="One Piece Icon" alt="One Piece Icon Image">   How's it possible for a powerful pirate to not have a high bounty or no bounty at all.</h3>
        <p>The World Government doesn't have the knowledge to know the true power of each pirate. If a powerful pirate has a low to no bounty, then it means that there were no or few representatives of the government witnessing how dangerous that pirate really is. One example of a low bounty is Chopper, only because he is mistaken as the Straw Hat's pet and is not considered to be an actual crewmember.
            </p>

            While humans with gigantism are at least 2 times taller than a regular human but are still smaller than a giant.</p>

        <p>The Marines, The Shichibukai(Seven Warlords of the Sea), & the Yonkou(Four Emperors).
            </p>

        <h3><img src="images/one_piece__icon26.png" title="One Piece Icon" alt="One Piece Icon Image">   What is the ranking system of the Marines in this series?</h3>

        <h3><img src="images/one_piece__icon26.png" title="One Piece Icon" alt="One Piece Icon Image">   Is Makino and Red Haired Shanks related to Luffy?</h3>
        <p>No, there was never such a speculation that all three of them are related with one another. Makino is only Luffy's friend while Shanks is his role model as well as a friend. Nothing more.</p>

        <h3><img src="images/one_piece__icon26.png" title="One Piece Icon" alt="One Piece Icon Image">   How did Luffy got that scar under his left eye?</h3>
        <p>This was explained in the manga. When Luffy was a kid, he stabbed himself under the eye to prove to Red-Haired Shanks that he was a man. That scene was excluded from the anime.</p>

        <h3><img src="images/one_piece__icon26.png" title="One Piece Icon" alt="One Piece Icon Image">   How come Nico Robin doesn't show off a funny expression like everyone else does?</h3>
        <p>It's because her attitude is more mature than the other crew members. Plus she's been through a lot of dark moments in her life which results to her not being scared or surprised so easily.</p>
